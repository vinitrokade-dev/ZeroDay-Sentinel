        <h2>Cyber Awareness</h2>
        <p>
          In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity isn't just a corporate concern—it's a personal responsibility.
          From professionals to students, anyone who interacts with technology must be aware of the threats that come with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most overlooked yet dangerous threats comes from physical devices such as USBs, keyboards, and cables.
          These devices, when modified with malicious intent, can bypass software-level protections and directly compromise hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cyber awareness starts with understanding the tools attackers use and learning how to recognize and respond to these threats.
          Educating yourself and your organization about these vulnerabilities is the first and most crucial step toward digital security.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Physical access = complete control</strong>: Attackers love unattended ports.</li>
          <li><strong>Not all devices are what they seem</strong>: A charger can be a keylogger.</li>
          <li><strong>Education reduces risk</strong>: Awareness can prevent thousands in damage.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="device-card">
        <img src="images/Harmful Devices/rubber_ducky.png" alt="Rubber Ducky" />
        <h3>Rubber Ducky</h3>
        <p>This device mimics a keyboard and can inject pre-written commands into your computer in seconds. It's silent, quick, and leaves little trace.</p>
        <p>Commonly used in penetration testing, it can also be used maliciously to install malware or steal credentials within moments of connection.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="device-card">
        <img src="images/Harmful Devices/usbkill.png" alt="USB Killer" />
        <h3>USB Killer</h3>
        <p>This device sends a high-voltage charge through the USB port, destroying your hardware instantly. No data is stolen—just eliminated.</p>
        <p>Primarily used for sabotage, the USB Killer is a terrifying example of how physical access can be weaponized.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="device-card">
        <img src="images/Harmful Devices/o.mgcable.png" alt="O.MG Cable" />
        <h3>O.MG Cable</h3>
        <p>Looks like an ordinary charging cable, but inside it hides a chip that records keystrokes and can transmit data wirelessly to attackers.</p>
        <p>It’s perfect for stealth attacks where the user remains unaware that they are being monitored or compromised.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="device-card">
        <img src="images/Harmful Devices/lan turtle.png" alt="LAN Turtle" />
        <h3>LAN Turtle</h3>
        <p>Disguised as a USB Ethernet adapter, this device gives attackers remote access to internal networks. It’s a favorite for persistent threats.</p>
        <p>Often used for post-exploitation in red team operations, it allows silent backdoor access for long periods.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="device-card">
        <img src="images/Harmful Devices/wifi_pineapple.png" alt="WiFi Pineapple" />
        <h3>WiFi Pineapple</h3>
        <p>It creates fake WiFi access points to intercept users' traffic and credentials. Looks legitimate but is built for phishing over the air.</p>
        <p>It can force connections, perform DNS spoofing, and is a staple in wireless penetration testing kits.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="device-card">
        <img src="images/Harmful Devices/keysweeper(internal).jpg" alt="Keylogger" />
        <h3>Keylogger</h3>
        <p>This sneaky device logs everything typed on a keyboard. Some are disguised as USB extensions or power adapters.</p>
        <p>Keyloggers are silent attackers that aim to steal passwords, banking information, or even entire documents over time.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="device-card">
        <img src="images/Harmful Devices/hackrf.jpeg" alt="BadUSB" />
        <h3>BadUSB</h3>
        <p>Firmware-modified USBs can impersonate any device—like keyboards or network cards—making them undetectable by antivirus.</p>
        <p>These USBs can install malware, create backdoors, or perform automated attacks immediately after insertion.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="device-card">
        <img src="images/Harmful Devices/flipper.jpg" alt="Flipper Zero" />
        <h3>Flipper Zero</h3>
        <p>Flipper is a multi-tool for pentesters and hackers. It can interact with RFID, NFC, IR, and Bluetooth, and can be used to clone IDs or access points.</p>
        <p>While legal and open-source, in the wrong hands it can compromise wireless systems quickly and discreetly.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Cybersecurity is not just about firewalls and antivirus software. 
          It’s about staying aware of both digital and physical threats. 
          Any physical port can become a vulnerability if not protected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Educating your team, using device monitoring tools, and enforcing strict access controls can significantly reduce the risk of cyber-attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Always question unfamiliar devices and stay informed about the evolving tools used by attackers.
